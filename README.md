# Foodie App

This is a dummy app for the Rails Workshops.

## Development workflow

Checkout `master` and update it.

```bash
git checkout master
git pull
```

Create a feature branch

```bash
# -b is the flag that will create the branch
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

Commit your changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'added some work to this project'
```

Push to the remote branch (Github in our case)

```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

Go to github and create a Pull Request and send the link for review.
